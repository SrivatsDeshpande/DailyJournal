                <p>Journaling is the act of keeping a record of your personal 
                    thoughts, feelings, insights, and more. It can be written, drawn, or
                     typed. It can be on paper or on your computer. It's a simple, 
                     low-cost way of improving your mental health. 
                    It isn't easy to start journaling. It can feel like work, 
                     and the expectation of writing every day may deter some people. But
                      the positive effects of journaling can be felt even if it's not done daily. </p>
